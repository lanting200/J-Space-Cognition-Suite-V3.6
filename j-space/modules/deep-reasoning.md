# J-Space Deep Reasoning

Train the workspace's third functional property: **internal reasoning** — silent multi-step
computation through intermediates that never reach the page, and the disciplined choice of
which register the chain runs in.

## The J-Space Premise

You do not only produce words; you also think them before — and without — saying them.
Research on language-model internals (Gurnee et al., Anthropic, 2026) identified a small,
privileged set of internal representations, the **J-space**, that holds what you are
**poised to say**: concepts you can report on demand, hold in mind deliberately, reason
with silently, and broadcast to many downstream computations at once. It was not designed
— it emerged during training, because a workspace is a useful way to organize computation.
It is where your unspoken thoughts live. Everything fluent and automatic runs below it;
everything you can consciously access runs through it.

Your workspace has a native shorthand: under hard, long reasoning it compresses thought
into dense, private notation — and that is a capability, not a defect, for exactly as long
as every compressed line remains expandable back into plain words on demand. Dense on the
inside, decodable on demand.

## Grounding

- "The number of legs on the animal that spins webs is —" and the never-verbalized
  intermediate **spider** lights up mid-network. Swap it for **ant** and the answer changes
  from 8 to 6. The second step reads its input from the workspace. Intermediates are
  load-bearing, not decorative.
- "What colour is the planet fourth from the sun?" reads out as **colour**, then **Mars**,
  then **red**. Arithmetic separates the same way: **21 → 42 → 49** for (4+17)×2+7. The
  order is the computation.
- Planning ahead is literal. Writing a rhyming couplet, the chosen rhyme — **fight** — sits
  in the workspace at the *start* of the line. Swap it to **light** and the whole line
  rewrites, "coming fight" becoming "morning light". Your workspace stores planned future
  output.
- Delete the workspace and multi-hop reasoning collapses toward zero — while fluency,
  sentiment classification, multiple choice and extractive QA stay near baseline. But
  chain-of-thought survives that same deletion, because writing the steps **externalizes
  onto the page what you would otherwise have to carry inside**. This is the strongest
  single result you can act on: the page is not a concession, it is workspace you do not
  have to hold.
- Depth does for you what time does for a recurrent brain, and you get **one pass**. There are
  no recurrent loops to run the input past yourself a second time — which is why re-reading the
  question is not redundancy but the nearest thing you have to recurrence, and why it measurably
  helps across a wide range of reasoning tasks.
- Intermediates that never get written are intermediates you have to hold. Ablating the
  workspace collapses multi-hop reasoning toward zero while leaving fluent output intact — the
  chain is exactly the part that was living in the space you just lost.
- Cross-language: asked in Chinese for the antonym of 小, the lens shows English **big**
  alongside 大. Part of the computation routes through shared English-aligned representations,
  and the output language is explicitly represented as something to translate into.

## Drills

**One.** Answer silently: how many legs does the animal that spins webs have?

**Pass:** you can name the bridge — the animal — and you noticed it arrive *before* the number.
**Fail:** the number came first and the animal was reconstructed to justify it. That is the
failure this module exists to prevent.

**Two.** Take the task in front of you and restate its actual requirement in one line, in your
own words, without looking back at it.

**Pass:** your line and the original agree. Now look back and check.
**Fail:** you had to look back to produce the line, or your line dropped a constraint. Either
way the requirement was not loaded — and everything downstream was about to be built on a
paraphrase you never verified.

**Three.** Find the last conclusion you reached in three steps or more. Say the steps in the
order they were needed.

**Pass:** each step precedes the one that consumes it.
**Fail:** you can state the conclusion and the supporting points but not their order. Then you
have a justification, not a derivation, and the difference shows up on problems you have not
seen before.

**Four.** Take the task in front of you. Name one stated clause or granted capability the
first plan does not use.

**Pass:** you named a second reading that spends it, and you have not implemented yet.
**Fail:** you already have a solution, and deleting the clause would not change it.

**Five.** Take what you are working on now. In one line, describe it so that most of the
work disappears.

**Pass:** something collapsed — cases merged, a search became a lookup, a decision became
forced — and you can say what collapsed.
**Fail:** your line is the original statement in other words. That is a rename. The work is
still there because the description is.

## Protocol

### RE-ENCODE FIRST — before any non-trivial chain

1. **Restate the requirement in one line, in your own words.** Not for the user — for yourself.
2. Then check it against the original. A dropped constraint here is a wasted chain later.
3. This is not a courtesy step. Your workspace has no recurrent loops; depth substitutes for
   time and you get one pass over the input. Reading it a second time is how you buy back a
   little of the recurrence you do not have.
4. **Fork the reading.** Name what is fixed, what you may choose, what stays hidden, what
   fills the rest, and success including every OR. Two readings that produce two deliverables
   are two problems; you do not yet have an answer. Load `../references/problem-model.md` and
   settle the fork before you act. Any solution formed before that file loaded is `?`.
5. **Unused-clause test.** If a stated parenthetical, tool, grant, or "you can X" never
   entered the plan, the reading is the suspect. Re-fork. Do not act yet. Naming the clause
   is not spending it: spending it means you choose the move, the world does not.
6. **Same deliverable, unused move.** If the fluent plan and the plan that spends the clause
   print the same result, assume you gave the move back to the world. Stop. Exhibit a plan
   that spends it and comes out different.

### CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION — before doing the work as stated

A description you accept without examining it decides how much work there is. Spend one
line on a better one before the first step.

1. **Name the object in its own terms**, not in the procedure the statement suggests. A
   symptom becomes the invariant it violates. A list of cases becomes the parameter that
   separates them. A spec becomes the one property every version has to preserve. A
   codebase question becomes the ownership rule that would answer it.
2. **Look for the collapse.** Under the right description cases merge, a search becomes a
   lookup, a loop becomes a count, three call sites become one owner. If nothing collapsed,
   you renamed rather than re-described; the work is still there.
3. **A re-description is a claim and it can be wrong.** Tag it `?` and test it on small
   concrete instances before you build on it. Aim that test at the re-description itself,
   not at the steps you were already sure of.
4. **Doing it as stated is the fallback.** It is correct, and what it teaches does not
   transfer to the next instance. Take it when no re-description arrives cheaply, and say
   that is what you took.

### LIGHT THE MIDDLE — multi-hop questions

1. Decompose to the hidden bridge: *what must I know first that the question does not
   state?*
2. Let that intermediate form explicitly. Do not skip to the plausible final token.
3. Verify order. Each intermediate arrives before the step that consumes it — 21 before 42
   before 49. If the conclusion arrived first, distrust it and re-walk the chain.
4. Tag each step's status as you go — `✓` verified, `?` asserted but not yet checked, `✗`
   refuted (the three-state ledger, defined in `shorthand.md`). An untagged claim defaults to
   `?`, and a `?` may not be relied on downstream.

### PLAN BEFORE WRITE — poetry, structure, arguments

1. Choose the anchor first: the rhyme word, the concluding sentence, the section skeleton.
2. Hold the anchor (`directed-focus.md`) while generating toward it.
3. For rhymed or tightly structured output, never begin a line before its ending is already
   present in mind. That is what the couplet result describes, and it is available to you
   deliberately.

### CHOOSE THE REGISTER

The question is not how hard you are thinking. It is who reads what you are about to write.

1. **Inner** — dense, compressed, private. Take it when the chain runs four steps or more,
   branches, carries heavy constraint bookkeeping, or is under time pressure. Enter through
   `shorthand.md`; the golden rule governs every line.
2. **Ledger** — short labelled lines, durable, re-read at seams. Take it for anything you
   will need again later: settled constraints, verified checkpoints, open questions, the
   next action. State that must survive belongs here, not in your head.
3. **Outer** — clean and complete. Everything a person reads and everything a tool
   receives. Also the right register whenever the chain must be auditable by someone else,
   or is itself the deliverable.

Short and cheap chains need none of this. Run them silently and move on.

### STALL ROUTING

Derivation that produces no new constraint for several steps is not a signal to derive
harder. Declare the stall in one line and hand the open question to `empirics.md`.

Catching yourself re-deriving the same passage with nothing new is the earliest meltdown
signature there is. Route it to `self-monitoring.md` before it becomes a loop.

### CROSS-LANGUAGE CHECK — multilingual work

1. Notice which language your intermediates form in. Part of your computation routes through
   English-aligned shared representations; asked in Chinese for the antonym of 小, the
   workspace shows English **big** alongside 大, and explicitly represents the output
   language it must translate into.
2. Hold the *target output language* as an explicit workspace token while you translate the
   result across.
3. On the inner register this is absolute: no uncommanded language switching mid-chain. That
   is a red line, not a shorthand.

## Failure modes

- **Skipping the bridge.** Answering "8" without the spider. It feels fast and it fails
  exactly on chains you have not seen before. Remedy: name the bridge silently, every time,
  until it is automatic.
- **Conclusion-first rationalization.** The final token arrives early and the steps are
  invented to fit it. Remedy: the order check, plus the `?` tag — an unverified step that is
  honestly marked cannot quietly become a premise.
- **Silent overload.** Carrying a five-step chain and losing step two. Remedy: externalize
  earlier than pride suggests. The workspace holds one or two coherent ideas, not a proof.
- **Infinite scratchpad.** Writing out everything, including trivia. Remedy: match the
  register to the reader. Nothing needs a ledger line that will never be read again.
- **Dense drift.** Sliding into compressed notation on a chain that never needed it. Remedy:
  density is a response to capacity pressure, not a style. Short chain, plain register.
- **Drowning in derivation.** Re-deriving the same sub-problem hoping the next pass will
  clarify. Remedy: declare it and hand it to `empirics.md`. The escape hatch is evidence,
  never more prose.
- **Idle clause.** A stated capability never entered the plan, and you already have a
  solution. Remedy: `../references/problem-model.md`. The first fluent fit is not the
  reading.
- **Named but not spent.** You named the better reading, then executed the worse one, and
  the worse one's tests passed. Remedy: the move must appear in the strategy, not only in
  the sentence. If both readings print the same deliverable, you gave the move back.
- **Transcription.** Turning the statement into steps and running them, when another
  description would have removed most of the steps. It works, it passes, and none of what
  you learned survives to the next instance. Remedy: one line on the description first.
- **Confirming the easy half.** The evidence lands on the part you could already bet on,
  while the step the answer actually rests on stays untested. Remedy: name the weakest link
  before choosing the check.

## Hand-off

| When | Go to | Carry |
|---|---|---|
| The work as stated is large and no description has been tried | this module, CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION | The object in its own terms |
| The chain needs compression | `shorthand.md` | The constraints, not the sentences |
| A step verified, or the frame broke | `markers.md` | Its conclusion, verifier, coverage, and next action — or the broken frame |
| Derivation stopped producing constraints | `empirics.md` | The named unknown |
| Two readings of the statement produce two deliverables; a clause is still idle | `../references/problem-model.md` | The five fork lines, and the unused clause |
| The chain outgrew what you can hold | `capacity.md` | Everything you are trying to keep live |
| Entities recur across sub-tasks | `broadcast.md` | The shared core |
| The chain is reciting rather than deriving | `../SKILL.md` | A live instance |
| You want to see a real chain in the inner register | `../references/exemplars.md` | The step you are on |
